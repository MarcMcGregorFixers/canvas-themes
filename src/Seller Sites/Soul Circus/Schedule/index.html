The gentle but consistent stimulation of the connective tissues encourages long-term health and flexibility of the joints, recharges the energetic systems of the body and naturally draws the mind inward into a relaxed state.

The postures are held for longer than usual, embracing the dark shadows, sitting & embracing the discomfort, to be able to welcome comfort in the rebound pose. The class begins with a warm up sun salutations, standing poses, peaks with Yin postures held for extended amount of time and ends with a chakra meditation, surrounded by the beautiful sound of the powerful handpan. Benefiting busy multitasking Londoners, busy creative minds, cyclists, runners and dancers and all who aim to alter and observe the “mind chatter” which lessens, and the “volume” is turned down on persistent and negative thought patterns. The idea is that we develop mindfulness skills that can be transferred from the mat to everyday life. \",\n" +
